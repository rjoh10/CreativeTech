          The heatmap is an interactive tool designed to inform residents about
          Boston's efforts to manage and reduce rodent populations. Developed in
          collaboration with Northeastern's Scout Labs, this dashboard
          visualizes real-time rodent activity trends and showcases the city's
          proactive mitigation strategies. Powered by data from multiple
          divisions within the Inspectional Services Department (ISD) and Public
          Works, the dashboard offers clear, actionable insights into the city's
          ongoing efforts to create cleaner, safer neighborhoods across Boston.
